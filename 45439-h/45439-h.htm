<p><i>Hôtel Métropole, Wednesday Night.</i>&mdash;Dinner in Whitehall Rooms
to celebrate completion of railway communication between Natal and
South Africa. Occasion important; list of guests comprehensive;
all the Colonies represented, whilst <span class="sc">Don José</span>, home from historic
Spain, happily typified the paternal British Lion glad to see its
cubs around it. <span class="sc">Walter Peace</span>, Agent-General for Natal, is the
Amphitryon&mdash;<i>le véritable Amphitryon où l'on dîne</i>. As <span class="sc">Sark</span> says,
"With <span class="sc">Peace</span> in the Chair and Plenty on the table, what more can
one desire?"</p>

<p class="center">Joe Chamberlion encouraging the Colonial Cubs.</p></div>

<p>An excellent dinner, marked by an innovation against which protest
cannot be made too early. Between the <i>entrée</i> and the joint
cigarettes served.
Worse still, they were lit and smoked; timidly
at first, but weak-minded
men seeing others start also
made themselves
uncomfortable.
Room soon filled with poisonous smoke of tobacco
and paper. I like a cigar at dinner,
or even two&mdash;in proper place.
This spoiling of
the palate midway
through a meal was wanton
flying in the face of Providence
who had next provided excellent
saddle of Welsh mutton.
Custom of interpolating
cigarette has not even colonial origin to recommend it.
"<span class="sc">Kicky</span>" likes it, 'tis true. But the British public scornfully asks,
"Who's <span class="sc">Kicky</span>?" and will be no wiser if I tell them he's a capitalist.</p>

<p>After dinner, speeches. For a man whose breast is blazoned with
Victoria Cross, never saw anyone in such a funk as <span class="sc">Redvers Buller</span>
when he rose to reply to toast to the Army. Knees shook; manly
cheek blenched; evidently moment when he contemplated turning
his back on foe and bolting. But pluck of British soldier prevailed,
and he pulled through. If alternative were open to him, would
rather have gone through the Ashantee Campaign again, or worked
his way once more through the sad Soudan.</p>

<p>Nothing of this feeling apparent in demeanour of old friend
<span class="sc">Martin F. Tupper</span>. General impression is that, like <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>,
he is dead. All a mistake; only changed his estate; dropped his earlier
initials; assumed name of <span class="sc">Charles</span>, with a baronetcy, the G.C.M.G.,
the C.B., and the High Commissionership of Canada. Talks prose
now instead of poetry. But the old style indelible, ineradicable.
His speech to-night marked by all the prosy, kindly, commonplace
verbosity of the Proverbial Philosophy of his earlier state.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Don José</span>, rising to respond to toast of his health, met with hearty
reception. Misguided man at end of room proposed to greet him as
"a jolly good fellow." Effort well meant; had the songster
managed, at outset, to strike right note, the thing might have been
done. As it was inappropriateness of this particular hymnal, combined
with a certain flatness in the opening notes of the songster,
chilled the choir. As <span class="sc">Sark</span> says, "jollity not precisely the quality
one associates with <span class="sc">Joe</span>." So the melody, after feebly fizzling round
the tables, was drowned in burst of laughter.</p>

<p>Occasion was, as <span class="sc">Don José</span> remarked, first time he had publicly
appeared in capacity of Minister for the Colonies. In every way
a happy one. A gathering representing the uttermost corners of the
Empire, each vying with the other in loyalty to Crown. New Secretary,
with easy grace, rose to height of situation. Struck lofty note
in his picture of our fellow-subjects throughout the world recognising
the great inheritance that has befallen them by mere virtue of
their citizenship. "They must feel," he said, in ringing voice that
found echo in the crowded room, "that no separate existence, however
splendid, could compare with that they enjoy equally with ourselves
as joint heirs of all the traditions of the past, joint partakers
of all the influence, resources, and power of the British Empire."</p>

<p>A speech not too long, splendidly pitched, admirably phrased, full of
the old Palmerstonian ring, and yet, if closely examined, signifying
nothing likely to embarrass a Minister in future relations either
with Colonies or foreign powers. Just the thing for the hour, and
the place. Full of promise for fresh triumphs for <span class="sc">Don José</span> on the
new pathway he surprised some people by selecting as his own.</p>

<p>After the Colonial Secretary, the Lord High Admiral. <span class="sc">Don
Currie</span>, also, though in quite a different way, in his best form.
Could not look upon him as with clasped hands, and eyes upraised to
a perturbed firmament, he protested against continued absence of
imperial subvention of mail packets to the Cape, without thinking
what a tragedian is here lost to the stage!</p>

<p>Threw quite a fresh light on the Spanish Armada. "Why," he
exclaimed, "the Spanish Armada, with the assistance of Portugal
and Mexico, did not include as many ships as are under my management
in the Castle fleet!"</p>

<p>"Let us be grateful," said <span class="sc">Sark</span>, as the man in the hat and cloak
department handed him through the pigeon-hole someone else's
overcoat, "that <span class="sc">Don Currie</span> was not born before his time or out of
his place. Had he been a subject of <span class="sc">Philip the Second</span>, he would
certainly have commanded the Armada. In which case the whole
course of history would have been changed, and to-day Great Britain
would have been even as Cuba."</p>

<h2>ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</h2>

<p>In this depressing weather it is always well to have something to
be thankful for. My own special subject for gratitude is the cessation
and final end of the Marlborough-Vanderbilt wedding. All
these columns of matrimonial gush which have been arriving by
mail and cable from America have been sufficient to make even a
good man curse his fellow-man, and retire to some other planet.
Perhaps the young Duke himself ought not to be blamed. I know
nothing against him except that he was arrested in New York for
"coasting" on a bicycle, and that he has made one speech in the
House of Lords. These are grave matters, no doubt, but they must
not be allowed to blast a young man's career at its very outset.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>Nor possibly are the <span class="sc">Vanderbilts</span> altogether in fault. They
possess many millions, and it is perhaps natural that they should
desire to celebrate the marriage of their daughter by spending some
of their dollars on diamonds, rubies, gold, silver, and exotic flowers.
But what is offensive about the business is the morbid excitement
of the American public. The American public may declare that it
was not excited; but, in that case, it is difficult to understand why
its newspaper proprietors should have flooded their columns with
descriptive gush in which not even the bride's underclothing is
spared from publicity.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>Moreover, this marriage was rehearsed. I don't think I am
putting the matter too strongly when I say that this constitutes an
outrage not only on good taste, but on all proper religious feeling.
I imagine the happy pair bowing and kneeling with their bridesmaids
and attendants, and the weeping maiden aunts who are never absent
from such a ceremony, going solemnly through the intricate maze of
responses, while a mock clergyman reads a mock service and all the
spectators indulge in a mockery of emotion and congratulation. For
myself I would as soon re-marry a hearse, as rehearse a marriage.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>The whole business is, in fact, an illustration of that passion for
tawdry display and vulgar ostentation in which the great American
Republic seems to have gone not one but about a million better (or
worse) than the parent stock. I sincerely hope that the supply of
marriageable peers and American heiresses is now exhausted, and
that we may hear no more of these international engagements.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>I spoke last week of the undergraduate in relation to his dog.
This week I should like to say a few words of the undergraduate in
relation to his clothes. It seems to be generally imagined that the
undergraduate is addicted to dressing himself out in the smartest
possible clothes for his daily stroll along King's Parade or the High.
Nothing can be further from the fact. The error is probably due to
those splendidly inaccurate descriptions of university life with which
novel readers have been of late perplexed. From these it might be
supposed that the undergraduate was in the habit of changing his
clothes some six times a day merely for purposes of display, and of
reserving his very smartest suit for the daily visit that he pays to
the gorgeous gambling-hells which are, as we all know, to be found
by the score in the suburban districts of Oxford and Cambridge.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>As a matter of fact, the average undergraduate is, in matters of
dress, the simplest of mankind. His great ideal is comfort, and as
old clothes are naturally more comfortable than new, it is quite a
common sight to see great Blues, presidents of clubs, shining lights
of the river, the field, or the schools arrayed in Norfolk jackets, in
trousers on which at least two winters have laid their defacing hand,
and in shirts which, though of an immaculate cleanness, show
evident signs of wear and tear in the cuff department.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>It must be remembered that the ordinary undergraduate only
wears the clothes of civilisation for about half of every day. During
the rest of the time he is to be found in the garb most appropriate to
his athletic pursuits. In the case of a rowing man, these extend
only to within six inches of his knees, and spectators have been heard
to wonder how such large and heavy frames can be supported on so
melancholy a deficiency of calves. I don't know how it is, but it is
a fact that if a rowing man stands more than seventy-two inches in
height, the girth of his calves will not exceed some ten inches.</p>

<hr class="medium" />

<p>If in writing thus of undergraduate dress I have destroyed a
cherished illusion, I can only express my regret; but I have a strong
feeling that the truth should be at last made to prevail, even against
the inexactitudes of university novelists.</p>

<p>The state of those who have read the novel before seeing the play,
is gracious; the state of those who have seen the play without having
previously read the novel, is the more gracious. <i>Svengali</i>, the weird
unwashed Hebrew, the fantastical, musical magician, so dominates
the story, that the author of his being will be remembered as <span class="sc">George
<i>Jew</i> Maurier</span>. And <i>Svengali</i> the Satanical, marvellously
impersonated
by Mr. <span class="sc">Beerbohm Tree</span>, stands out as the central figure of the
strange unconventional drama at the Haymarket. It isn't <i>Trilby</i>,
the hypnotised subject, but <i>Svengali</i>, the fearful "object," the dirty
demoniac hypnotiser, on whom all eyes are fixed, and in whom the
interest is centred. He is Shylock and Fagin, Mephistophelesized;
he is as loathsome as Hyde without Jekyl; he is the Spirit of Evil in
the story of the Devil's Violin; he is the haunting, cringing fiend in
the Shadowless Man; he is, in fact, the very Deuce himself.</p>

<p>"O don't you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt," is the "old song"
which, at first, <i>Miss Trilby O'Ferrall</i> "cannot sing," but which,
when hypnotised by Satanical <i>Svengali</i>, she does sing; and, with
this, and with one or two other ancient ditties in her rather limited
<i>répertoire</i>, she makes <i>Svengali's</i> fortune. The <i>Diva</i> is
beaten and
kicked by the savage <i>Svengali</i> (not in the presence of the audience)
as if she were his slave, and he the brutal slave-driver. But,
<i>why this treatment, if he has only to hypnotise her in order to
render her obedient to his slightest wish</i>? It is, I suppose,
considered necessary he should do so, in order to excite our
compassion for his victim, the unfortunate <i>Miss Trilby</i>, and so to
bring down upon him the just chastisement which is the immediate
cause of his death. Otherwise, as <i>Svengali</i> has told her he loves
her, and as she (hypnotised of course) becomes his wife, why this
horrible ill-treatment? This seems to me to be the only weak
point in the plot of Mr. <span class="sc">Paul Potter's</span> undeniably clever end most
effective play. But surely <i>Svengali's</i> diabolically jealous hatred of
"<i>Little Billee</i>," his successful rival in the affections of <i>Trilby</i>
(when unhypnotised) would be sufficient, motive for the brutal
insult he inflicts on <i>Miss O'Ferrall's</i> faithful, but insignificant,
little lover, and for which, at the hands of the strong man, <i>Taffy</i>,
the fiend-like <i>Svengali</i> has to pay with his life.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Paul Potter</span>," a name hitherto historically associated with the
celebrated "Bull," not Papal but pictorial, now about two centuries
old, has hit the bull's-eye this time, and will realise a good round
sum from <span class="sc">John</span> "of that ilk." Thoroughly does <span class="sc">Paul</span> deserve it
for his audacious ingenuity and his daring disregard of dramatic
conventionality. His third act, in which there is hardly any action
until the second entrance of <i>Svengali</i>, is so contrived that a few
persons narrating in dialogue what they are supposed to see happening
off the stage, work up the excitement of the audience to
such a pitch that they instinctively cry "hush!" in order that
they too may join with the characters on the scene in listening to
the voice of an invisible <i>Trilby</i> singing the hackney'd ditty "<i>Ben
Bolt</i>"! This is a triumph due to the dramatist, to Messrs. <span class="sc">Lionel
Brough</span> (<i>The Laird</i>), Mr. <span class="sc">Edmund Maurice</span> (<i>Taffy</i>), and
Mr.
<span class="sc">Patrick Evans</span> (<i>Little Billee</i>), with <span class="sc">Mrs. Filippi</span> as
<i>Madame Vinard</i>.</p>

<p>In this scene Mr. <span class="sc">Tree's</span> <i>Svengali</i> is no longer the squalid
<i>Fagin</i>,
but is like the old pictures of <span class="sc">Paganini</span>, the famous violinist, decked
with the jewellery of the once celebrated "Mons. <span class="sc">Jullien</span>." Now
comes the exhibition of <i>Svengali's</i> venomous hatred for <i>Little
Billee</i>,
in whose face he spits; a horrible and revolting thing to see done on
the stage, even though we know he is "only purtendin'." For
this disgusting exhibition of temper, he is half strangled by the
Welsh giant <i>Taffy</i>.</p>

<p>"A Baird in the Haymarket is worth two in the Book."<br />
(<i>Signed</i>) <span class="sc">P-l P-tt-r</span>.</p></div>

<p><i>Trilby</i>, no longer under the hypnotic influence of <i>Svengali</i>, sings
horribly out of tune; the audience are supposed to rise in their
wrath and threaten to wreck the house (rather a strong order this,
but, as I have hinted, what no other dramatist dares <span class="sc">Potter</span> dares);
and then the miserable <i>Svengali</i>, after writhing and twisting in his
last agony, and "doing a back-fall" across a table with his head
downwards towards the foot-lights, his breath shaken out of his
body, his hair out of curl, his eyes staring horribly, dies,&mdash;a terrible
topsy-turvy death never before seen on any stage.</p>

<p>In the last Act poor ill-used <i>Miss O'Ferrall</i> also dies. The
dramatist has prevented this scene from being an anti-climax,
wherein lay the danger, by preparing the audience with a weird
story told by <i>Zouzou</i> (Mr. <span class="sc">Herbert Ross</span>) of his having seen the
ghost of <i>Svengali</i>, who, soon afterwards, appears as a portrait of
himself&mdash;not "a speaking likeness," as he does not utter a syllable,&mdash;done
in "luminous paint," within a picture-frame which has been
forwarded as a nice little wedding present to
<i>Miss O'Ferrall</i> on the eve of her marriage
with <i>Little Billee</i>, accompanied by a letter in
<i>Svengali's</i> handwriting, sent probably through
the infernal agency of the Dead Letter Office
authorities. Thus the Satanical <i>Svengali</i>,
taking a hint from the Commendatore's
statue in <i>Don Giovanni</i>, dominates the play
till the final descent of the curtain.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="sc">Dorothea Baird</span>, with naked tootsies
exposed to the naked eye&mdash;she is henceforth
"Miss <span class="sc">Dolly Baird</span>-feet"&mdash;cannot be improved
on as the pretty, gay, sad, much-suffering
hypnotised <i>Trilby</i>. Of all possible <i>Trilbys</i>,
"<span class="sc">Baird's</span> the Best." The play could not be
better acted all round. The French <i>Duc</i>, formerly
<i>Zouzou</i> the Zouave, is first-rate. Mr.
<span class="sc">Charles Allan</span>, as a respectable English Archdeacon, finding
himself in Bohemian Paris, is excellent. The success of <i>Trilby</i>, with
her nude tootsies, may give new life to the ancient slang inquiry,
"How's your poor feet?"</p>

<div class="poem width48">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Remember, remember, the fifth o' November"? You bet if there's any one does, 'tis a Cabby.</p>
<p>November's the month when all London's smudged out, and the Cockneyist driver runs wild as a babby.</p>
<p>Eugh! I could tell you some chump-chilling tales about life on the box in a London peasouper.</p>
<p>Which 'im who would stand, after twenty or so, must be 'ard as tin-tacks, and as tough as a trooper.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Jimminy-whiz!" as <span class="sc">Yank Mushgrubber</span> puts it, our sububs in frost, <i>with</i> a fog, is tremenjous.</p>
<p>And arter a few 'ours cold crawl up to 'Ampstead, we long for a something to mend us <i>or</i> hend us,</p>
<p>We don't care much which, till the rum 'ot 'as warmed us. Ah! life is a matter of cumfable feeling,</p>
<p>And if it's wuth living or not is a question of temperytoor; that there ain't no concealing.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Wy, a chap warm, and one chilled to the marrer, is no more alike than hegg-flip and a hicicle.</p>
<p>Lose me about Peckham Rye in a fog, and I'd kick a stray dog, or knock over a bicycle.</p>
<p>Darkness as lets you drive <i>into</i> a lamp-post, and makes your shirt feel just like moist paper-mashy,</p>
<p>Would make a harkangel a porkypine; speshul if you've a lamp broke, and the branches are splashy.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>You just take a saint or a syrup, and git 'im to drive a cross fare, in a fog, up to Streatham,</p>
<p>And find 'isself lost, running into a churchyard or up a blind halley, and if 'e don't let 'em</p>
<p>Fly frequent and free, words beginning in d, and a few more loud letters, as bring conserlation</p>
<p>In trials and tantrums to cabbies <i>and</i> gents, you can make 'im archbishop without consecration!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I'm nuts upon good old November&mdash;sometimes&mdash;though, when fog isn't on, and there ain't <i>too</i> much drizzle,</p>
<p>A spin through the sububs about ten o'clock, on the fifth, when the place seems aflare and a fizzle</p>
<p>With bonfires and fireworks, and up through the tree-tops the rockets go whizzing and busting like winking;</p>
<p>Wy, somehow it makes me feel just like a boy again; not a bad feeling, at least to my thinking.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Some years agone, on a damp, misty Guy-night, a jolly-faced gent, with one eye, and a bundle</p>
<p>As looked like a parcel o' props, came towards me a-trottin' as brisk as 'is short legs could trundle;</p>
<p>"Take me to Tooting?" 'e garsps. "<i>At</i> a price, Sir," I arnsers 'im sharp. "Right!" sez 'e; "put a name to it!"</p>
<p>"Fog's thickenin' up, Sir," I sez. "If you're game to say&mdash;so-much&mdash;I'm on." And the old gent <i>was</i> game to it.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Fust we'd a liquor, and then 'e sez "Fireworks!" a-bossing 'is bundle with one heye a-glitter.</p>
<p>"Don't blow us up, Sir. I ain't got no licence to carry hexplosives," I sez with a titter.</p>
<p>"Young 'uns a-waiting at Tooting," 'e sez; "so drive sharp, and I won't be too tight on the pocket;</p>
<p>I do like a good firework frolic, with boys, though I blew this heye out&mdash;<i>as</i> a boy&mdash;with a rocket."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Plucky old cock, and most pleasant!" thinks I, tooling off at full trot with old <span class="sc">Brock</span>. "Here's a barney!"</p>
<p>But I was a mossel too previous this time, as I jolly well found when arf way through my journey.</p>
<p>Just this side o' Balham the fog grew&mdash;well black! There ain't no other word for it. Black as Thames banks are,</p>
<p>And thick as their mud. It you arsk <i>where</i> we got, you carn't know what a London Pertikler's queer pranks are.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>We got <i>everywhere</i> save to Tooting, I fancy. Slap on to a common, bang into a river,</p>
<p>Or something dashed like it; I stuck to the box till my fingers were ice and my spine all a-shiver;</p>
<p>Then took out my lamp, and led <i>Molly</i> a mile or so. 'Twasn't no good. We pulled up in a medder,</p>
<p>Aside of a ditch wich I bloomin' near plumped in. "Hillo!" sez old <span class="sc">Brock</span>. "That was nearly a header!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Tarblow Vivong!</i> Not so very much <i>vivong</i>, though, seeing the lot was 'arf dead with the chatters.</p>
<p>"Well," sez old One-heye, "where <i>are</i> we, I wonder? Two guys&mdash;<i>without bonfires!</i> As mad as two 'atters</p>
<p>To try it so fur. 'Ave a nip! Ah! that's better. Don't grizzle! Neat brandy, like love and like ire, works</p>
<p>In warming one up. If we <i>could</i> draw attention. By Jove! 'Appy thought!! <i>We will let off some fireworks!!!</i>"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So said, and so done! Talk of pantermines! Scott! If you'd seen hus two shivering, wropt-up, grey ghostes.</p>
<p>Like two steaming bundles, a tumbling around, fixing rockets and catherine-wheels to damp postes,</p>
<p>And striking of splutt'ring fusees, you'd 'a' thought we was demons a doin' of Guy Fox's duties.</p>
<p>At last&mdash;<i>whizz!</i> Away went a couple of rockets a-rending the fog, reg'lar red-and-green beauties.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Don't talk of Der Fryshoots! We looked like a party of spooks celebrating the fifth in old bogland;</p>
<p>Wy even poor <i>Molly</i> pricked up 'er froze ears at this "Whistler-like picter of Fireworks in Fogland."</p>
<p>As old One-heye called it, wotever 'e meant. But it 'ad its effect though, for torches come flaring,</p>
<p>And voices come 'owling across the damp flats, to inquire wot it was that still neighbourhood scaring.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"Wy <i>Huncle!!!</i>" a sharp little nipper voice squeaks as the party drew nigh. Cries old <span class="sc">Brock</span>, "Wot, young <span class="sc">Teddy</span>!"</p>
<p>We wasn't a bow-shot away from the 'ouse where old One-heye was due, and the Guy-games all ready,</p>

<h2>THE IMPERIAL FEDERALIST'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> Is not the idea of the Federation of the British Empire
merely a dream?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Scarcely, since the matter has attracted the attention of
Mr. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>, who is hardly a visionary.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Has public opinion anent the question seen any change of late?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Distinctly. The idea is at this moment popular. Ten years
ago, what may now be called a dream was regarded as a nightmare.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the chief difficulty in the way of Imperial Federation?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The varieties of race. A Canadian is scarcely an Australian,
and there is little in common between a Hindoo and a native of the
Cape.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But cannot much be done in the direction of merging the
cosmopolitan elements of the British Empire into one huge family
by establishing under the shadow of the Union Jack the penny post?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Such is the opinion of Mr. <span class="sc">Henniker-Heaton, M.P.</span></p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And could not free trade for the colonies, as distinguished from
protection applied to foreign countries, be successfully employed?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Such is the opinion of several Members of the Government.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Has any other plan occurred to the patriotic statesman?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes; it has been believed that a general tax for the National
Defence would be a bond of union between the colonies and the
mother country.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Does there not already exist a stronger tie than taxation?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly. The Empire has a common friend, adviser,
amuser, and instructor, beloved of all the world.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Does, then, the profound respect felt for this popular personage
keep the Empire in accord?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Unquestionably. The popular personage represents not only
Britons at home, but Britons beyond the sea.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And where is this popular personage found?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> In every part of the colonies, in India, in China, in fact,
everywhere.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But has not this popular personage headquarters in London?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He has, at 85, Fleet Street.</p>

<h2 class="sans">OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span> is obviously not the most fitting
person to review his own history. It has been
enough for him during the last fifty-four
years to make it. But a word must be said in
these columns of <i>The History of Punch</i>, just
issued in a handsome volume by Messrs.
<span class="sc">Cassell &amp; Co.</span> Through four years Mr. <span class="sc">Spielmann</span>
has been engaged upon what he indicates on
every page has proved a labour of love. There
was danger that enthusiastic admiration for
the subject might induce in the author a
fulsome tone that would have been fatal to
the historical and literary value of the book.
Mr. <span class="sc">Spielmann</span> happily avoids that pitfall.
He is, upon occasion, sternly and, my Baronite
adds, justly critical. But it is the personal
traits in his story that will most attract. In
his pages there live once more for the world,
seen in the borrowed but skilfully managed
light of intimate personal acquaintance, figures
whose memories are ever enshrined in the
hearts of those who still from week to week
gather round the old "Mahogany Tree."
<span class="sc">Mark Lemon</span>, <span class="sc">Shirley Brooks</span>, <span class="sc">Tom Taylor</span>,
<span class="sc">Leech</span>, <span class="sc">Keene</span>, <span class="sc">Douglas Jerrold</span>, The
<span class="sc">Professor</span>,
<span class="sc">Tom Hood</span>, <span class="sc">Thackeray</span>, <span class="sc">Dicky Doyle</span>,
<span class="sc">William Bradbury</span>, <span class="sc">G. A. à Beckett</span> and, a
generation later, his gifted son <span class="sc">Gil</span>&mdash;all, all
are gone, the once familiar faces. They are
met with again in Mr. <span class="sc">Spielmann's</span> book, the
pen and pencil sketches illustrated by admirably
reproduced contemporary portraits. The
inner history of <i>Punch</i> is a subject that has
ever had a fascination for the British public.
Attempts, more or less futile, to gratify the
desired acquaintance have been made at various
times through the last thirty years. Mr.
<span class="sc">Spielmann</span> has not only brought singular
aptitude to the task assigned to himself, but
has had the advantage of the cordial assistance
of divers men having personal knowledge
of events they record and personages
of whom they speak. <i>Mr. Punch</i> desires to
add his testimony to the general approval the
<i>History</i> has received by the voice of the
Press. The work, full of difficulty and not
without delicacy, is thoroughly well done.
Looking at himself in the mirror held up by
Mr. <span class="sc">Spielmann</span>, <i>Mr. Punch</i> finds no flaw in
the glass.</p>

<p>My Baronite would not advise those about
to travel to take passage by any ship, whithersoever
bound, of the start whereof <span class="sc">Clark
Russell</span> knows anything. His cruisers mostly
set out in fine weather, with swelling breeze, in
the full sunshine of circumstance. Then
comes a hitch, and there follow the most
blood-curdling adventures that ever happened
since men first began to go down to do business
in the great waters. The marvel of it is
that Mr. <span class="sc">Russell's</span> imagination never flags,
nor is he ever at loss for those minute details
which, skilfully and artistically piled up, go
to make a living picture. <i>Heart of Oak</i>, his
last work, just published by <span class="sc">Chatto and
Windus</span>, is worthy to take its place in the
matchless roll of his sea stories. Of living
writers Mr. <span class="sc">Russell</span>, alike in style and
method, most nearly approaches the classic
standard of <span class="sc">Defoe</span>. In his last work he has
captured the stormy seas south of Cape
Horn, brings home their turmoil, their snow
squalls, their icebergs, and a general sense of
their desolation to the gentleman of England
who sits at home at ease. That historic
person's opportunity of making acquaintance
with those interesting parts is decidedly more
agreeable and, under Mr. <span class="sc">Clark Russell's</span>
guidance, is scarcely less informing than a
voyage in the <i>Lady Emma</i>, a vessel of six
hundred tons, which was the sad fate of the
principal characters in this thrilling story.</p>

<p>The Baron feels it incumbent upon him to
correct a statement in Mr. <span class="sc">T. H. S. Escott's</span>
most readable and interesting work, entitled
<i>Platform, Press, Politics, and Play</i>, which,
if allowed to go uncontradicted, would thereby
allow a great error to creep into University
and Dramatic History. Mr. <span class="sc">Escott</span> says
that the late Mr. <span class="sc">Alfred Thompson</span> "had,
together with several others, been one of the
A. D. C.'s founders at Cambridge." This is
not so; Mr. <span class="sc">Alfred Thompson</span> had taken his
degree, and "gone down," some four years
before the A. D. C. was founded; <i>vide</i> preface
to <i>Personal Reminiscences of the A. D. C.</i>,
first paragraph, and also p. xi. of the same.
Mr. <span class="sc">Escott</span> is a most entertaining companion,
as is also Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Russell</span>, whose profession
was for years "entertaining," and
who wrote such songs as the world will not
willingly let die. "<i>Woodman Spare that Tree</i>"
is one of them. The <span class="sc">Russell</span> Reminiscences
(published by <span class="sc">Macqueen</span>, in one volume,
entitled "<i>Cheer, Boys, Cheer!</i>") the
Baron must take leave to correct on one
point. <span class="sc">Henry Russell</span> alludes to "that distinguished
<i>Punch</i> trio, <span class="sc">Douglas Jerrold</span>,
<span class="sc">Mark Lemon</span>, and <span class="sc">George Cruikshank</span>."
The last mentioned was never "on <i>Punch</i>."
He was a great friend of <span class="sc">Mark Lemon's</span>, but
never drew for <i>Mr. Punch</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">O mores!</span>&mdash;Farewell to the adjective <i>gallant</i>
as a prefix to "little Wales," for no longer
can it justly be used in such conjunction!
The <i>British Lady Football Club</i> gave an exhibition
game in Cardiff, and the inhabitants,
says the <i>South Wales Daily News</i>, gathered
in their thousands to witness the display,
in which they were intensely interested. But&mdash;<i>horribile
dictu</i>&mdash;whenever a fair <i>footeress</i>
"came a cropper, the crowd, <i>of course, shouted
with glee"!</i> <i>Of course!</i> When a recreant
male sustains a fall, what expressions of
tender solicitude burst from the sympathetic
lady-spectator's lips! And this her reward!
If any of our Gallic neighbours had been

<p><span class="sc">Injured Innocence.</span>&mdash;A Bristol paper
lately suggested that possibly some local
butcher might have bought some of the
thousands of sheep brought from Montreal
in the <i>Memphis</i> steamship. The very idea
of such a thing has scandalised the local
trade, and a butcher wrote to repel the vile
aspersion. The paper says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
It is refreshing to hear from this subscriber in
the trade that, after trying it once some years ago,
he has never had a bit of foreign meat in his shop
since. We are afraid we must not give his name,
though he is one of the best known butchers in
Bristol.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This is excellent. Why should not local
bodies everywhere give prizes to butchers
who sell no foreign meat? It would be protection,
somebody objects? Yes, it would be
rank protection to the meat-consumer, and
as such it is never likely to be adopted.</p>
